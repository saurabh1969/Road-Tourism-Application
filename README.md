In current tourism system, whenever a tourist visits any city, he/she has to depend upon the guide or on others for possible routes .The proposed project serve as a system that does not require a physical guide .The system will tell all possible routes.

Motivation:
Today, everyone likes to travel. People like to explore new thoughts, witness different cultures, and traditions .But on faces lot of problems, since he/she does not know anything about the place .More precisely, cab drivers take undue advantage of this. They do not take a direct route to your destination for extra earnings. We have to always rely on others when we visit somewhere .That is why we come up with this project which helps the user in that dire situation. Usage of this system will obviously save a lot of money and time of the person. This system does not require internet connection as well which is an added advantage.
Procedure:

2) If the user is new he/she will have to fill the registration form (username, password, email,  first name, last name, etc.).
3) These details will be submitted to database.
4) After logging in, the user will get a screen with two fields, Source and Destination.
5) User can put the name of the place and get the all possible routes to the destination.
6) In login page, there will be fields for admin to log in.
7) Admin can operate the system. Admin will get the facilities to update, delete and add data to the system.
8) Admin can also remove and retrieve all the information of the registered user.
